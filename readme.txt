== Description ==

This plugin disables the Pingback functionality in your blog.  

If a request tries to use the pingback method, they will get an error:

"server error. requested method pingback.ping does not exist."

Note:  Disabling pingbacks means you will not receive notifications when other blogs link to your content.
